# Stress Reduction and Remedies
------
The goal of this project is to notify individuals who experience regular stress and provide them with useful remedies to reduce their stress levels. To achieve this, a neural network model was trained using machine learning techniques on a small dataset that includes features commonly provided by fit-bit or smart watch devices, such as 'Respiration Rate', 'Blood Oxygen', 'Sleeping Hours', and 'Heart Rate'. The trained model boasts an impressive accuracy of 97%.

Furthermore, the project incorporates the use of the "chat-gpt3.5" RESTful API, provided by OpenAI, to suggest stress reduction remedies based on the aforementioned features and the user's current place (room, office, park, etc.), as fed into the web application. To access this functionality, an API key needs to be generated from OpenAI.

By leveraging this integrated approach, the project aims to effectively identify individuals experiencing stress and provide them with personalized remedies to mitigate their stress levels, thereby promoting better mental health and well-being.
